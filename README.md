# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Tool (Java)

### **Project Overview**
This is a Java-based encryption program I developed that uses the **Caesar Cipher** technique. It allows a user to input a message and a "shift" value to transform plain text into encrypted ciphertext.

### **How it Works**
The program iterates through each character of the input string and shifts it by the user-defined value using its ASCII/Unicode representation.

**Example:**
* **Original Message:** `Hello`
* **Shift Value:** `4`
* **Encrypted Message:** `LIPPS`

### **Key Technical Features**
* **Input Handling:** Uses the `Scanner` class for user interaction.
* **String Manipulation:** Implements `.charAt()` and `.length()` to process text.
* **Logic:** Handles uppercase and lowercase character shifts effectively.
